<sect> About <p>

<url url="http://quakespasm.sourceforge.net" name="QuakeSpasm">
is a modern, cross-platform Quake 1 engine based on <url url="http://www.celephais.net/fitzquake" name="FitzQuake">.
</p><p>
It includes support for 64 bit CPUs and custom music playback, a new
sound driver, some graphical niceities, and numerous bug-fixes and other improvements.
</p><p>
Quakespasm utilizes either the SDL or SDL2 frameworks, so choose which one works best for you.
SDL is probably less buggy, but SDL2 has nicer features and smoother mouse input - though no CD support.

</itemize>


<sect> Hints <p>

<em>Visit the <url url="http://www.celephais.net/fitzquake" name="FitzQuake homepage"> for a full run-down of the engine's commands and variables.</em>

<itemize>
<item>To disable some changes, use "<bf>quakespasm -fitz</bf>"

<item>Quakespasm's custom data is stored in "quakespasm.pak". Install this file alongside your id1 directory to enable the custom console background and other minor features.

<item>For different sound backend drivers use "<bf>SDL_AUDIODRIVER=</bf><em>DRIVER</em><bf> ./quakespasm</bf>"
, where DRIVER may be alsa, dsp, pulse, esd ...

<item><bf>Shift+Escape</bf> draws the Console.
<item>From the console, use <bf>UP</bf> to browse the command line history and
<bf>TAB</bf> to autocomplete command and map names.
<item>There is currently no CD Music volume support and SDL2 doesn't support CD audio. cd_sdl.c needs replacing with cd_linux.c, cd_bsd.c etc..
<item>In windows, alternative CD drives are accessible by "<bf>quakespasm -cddev F</bf>" (for example)

<item>Quakespasm allows loading new games (mods) on the fly with "<bf>game</bf> <em>GAMENAME {-quoth/hipnotic/rogue}</em>"

<item>Use "<bf>quakespasm -condebug</bf>" to save console log to "qconsole.log". SDL2 builds no longer generate stdout.txt/stderr.txt.
</itemize>
</p>

<sect1>Music Playback<p>
Quakespasm can play various external music formats, including MP3, OGG and FLAC.
<itemize>
<item>Tracks should be named like "track02.ogg", "track03.ogg" ... (there is no track01) and placed into "Quake/id1/music".
<item>Unix users may need some extra libraries installed: "libmad" or "libmpg123" for MP3, and "libogg" and "libvorbis" for OGG.
<item>As of 0.90.0, music is played back at 44100 Hz by default with no need to adjust "-sndspeed".
<item>Use the "-noextmusic" option to disable this feature.
<item>See <url url="Quakespasm-Music.txt"> for more details.
</itemize>

<sect1>Controller Support<p>
The SDL2 variant of Quakespasm supports Xbox 360 style game controllers.
<p>
The default configuration uses the left analog stick for movement and the right for looking.
<p>
If your controller doesn't work you can try placing <url url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB/master/gamecontrollerdb.txt" name="this file"> in your Quake directory, it is a community-maintained database that adds support for more controllers to SDL2.

<sect2>Cvars<p>
<itemize>
<item>joy_deadzone - Fraction of the stick travel to be deadzone, between 0 and 1. Default 0.175.
<item>joy_deadzone_trigger - Fraction of trigger range required to register a button press on the analog triggers, between 0 and 1. Default 0.2.
<item>joy_sensitivity_yaw/pitch - Max angular speed in degrees/second when looking. Defaults are 300 for yaw (turning left/right) and 150 for pitch (up/down).
<item>joy_exponent - For the look stick, the stick displacement (between 0 and 1) is raised to this power. Default is 3. A value of 1 would give a linear relationship between stick displacement and fraction of the maximum angular speed.
<item>joy_invert - Set to 1 to invert the vertical axis of the look stick.
<item>joy_swapmovelook - Set to 1 to swap the left and right analog stick functions. Default 0, move on the left stick, look on the right stick.
<item>joy_enable - Set to 0 to disable controller support. Default 1.
</itemize>

<sect2>Buttons<p>
Some of the controller buttons are hardcoded to allow navigating the menu:

<itemize>
<item>Back - alias for TAB
<item>Start - alias for ESC
<item>DPad, analog sticks - mapped to arrow keys
<item>A Button - alias for ENTER in menus
<item>B Button - alias for ESC in menus
</itemize>

These buttons can be bound normally:

<itemize>
<item>LTRIGGER - Left trigger
<item>RTRIGGER - Right trigger
<item>LSHOULDER - Left shoulder button
<item>RSHOULDER - Right shoulder button
<item>LTHUMB - Clicking the left thumbstick
<item>RTHUMB - Clicking the right thumbstick
<item>ABUTTON
<item>BBUTTON
<item>XBUTTON
<item>YBUTTON
</itemize>
quakespasm.pak contains a default.cfg which has been updated to give some default bindings. L/R shoulder buttons are bound to weapon switching, and L/R triggers are jump and attack.
<p>
The controller support started as Jeremiah Sypult's implementation in Quakespasm-Rift and also uses ideas and code from LordHavoc (DarkPlaces).

<sect> Compiling and Installation<p>
<p>Quakespasm's (optional) custom data is now stored in the file <bf>quakespasm.pak</bf>. This file should be placed alongside your quakespasm binary and <bf>id1</bf> directory.</p>
<p><em>To checkout the latest version of QuakeSpasm, do:</em>
<bf>svn co svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/quakespasm/code/trunk/quakespasm</bf></p>

<sect1> Linux/Unix <p>
After extracting the source tarball, browse the Makefile and edit the music streaming options, then
<code>
make
cp quakespasm /usr/local/games/quake (for example)
</code>
<newline>
Compile time options include
<itemize>
<item><bf>make DO_USERDIRS=1</bf> to include user directories support
<item><bf>make DEBUG=1</bf> for debugging
<item><bf>make SDL_CONFIG=</bf><em>/PATH/TO/SDL-CONFIG</em> for unusual SDL installations
<item><bf>make USE_SDL2=1</bf> to compile against SDL2 instead of SDL-1.2
</itemize>
<p>Streaming music playback requires "libmad" or "libmpg123" for MP3, and "libogg" and "libvorbis" for OGG files.
<p>The project can also be built with Codeblocks (project files included).</p>

<sect1> Windows <p>
The QuakeSpasm developers cross-compile windows binaries using <url url="http://www.mingw.org" name="MinGW"> and <url url="http://mingw-w64.sf.net" name="Mingw-w64">.

The project can also be built using Visual Studio 2005 (or newer).</p>

<sect1> Mac OS X <p>
A Quakespasm App (including program launcher and update framework) can be made using the <bf>Xcode</bf> template found in the MacOSX directory.

Alternatively, have a look at <bf>Makefile.darwin</bf> for more instructions on building from a console.
</p>

<sect> Known Bugs <p>
Brightness issues should be fixed with GLSL gamma in 0.90.1, if your system supports OpenGL 2. For reference on older systems:
<newline> 
Some versions of Xorg and SDL have brightness issues.
<newline>
Try setting "export SDL_VIDEO_X11_NODIRECTCOLOR=1", or if you have Xorg >= 7.5 and broken brightness,
these patched libSDL binaries may help.

<item> Change "games" / "mods" commands to list all subdirectories.
<item> Restore vid_refreshrate from fitzquake-0.85 for SDL2 builds.
<item> Alpha-masked model support. (MF_HOLEY: 0x4000).
<item> Change default screenshot format to png. The 'screenshot' command now supports optional format (tga, png or jpg) and quality (1-100) arguments.
<item> Revert "always run" changes from 0.85.9; move the QuakeSpasm customizations to a new "cl_alwaysrun" cvar. Set to 1 to scale forward/side/up speed by "cl_movespeedkey" (usually 2), and make "speedkey" act as "slowkey".
<item> Change "always run" menu option to offer "off" (cl_alwaysrun 0, cl_forwardspeed 200, cl_backspeed 200), "vanilla" (cl_alwaysrun 0, cl_forwardspeed 400, cl_backspeed 400) and "quakespasm" (cl_alwaysrun 1, cl_forwardspeed 200, cl_backspeed 200).
<item> New "r_scale" cvar. Set to 2, 3, or 4 to render the view at 1/2, 1/3, or 1/4 resolution.
<item> New "r_viewmodel_quake" cvar. Set to 1 for WinQuake gun position (from MarkV).
<item> New "find" / "apropos" command, searches for commands/cvar names for the given substring (from Spike).
<item> New "randmap" command for loading a random map.
<item> New "gl_cshiftpercent_contents", "gl_cshiftpercent_damage", "gl_cshiftpercent_bonus", "gl_cshiftpercent_powerup" cvars for tuning the strength of specic view blends.
<item> Fix macOS startup delay (avoid calling gethostbyname() for ".local" hostnames).
<item> Fix memory corruption in PF_lightstyle with out of bounds lightstyles.
<item> Fix crash in BoundPoly with polygons extending beyond +/-9999.

</itemize>
</p>

<sect1> Changes in 0.92.1<p>
<itemize>

</p>

<sect1> Changes in 0.92.0<p>
<itemize>
<item> SDL2 Game Controller support.
<item> Contrast support with new "contrast" cvar, behaving the same as MarkV. It may be a useful alternative to the existing gamma control for laptops in a bright environment, etc. Raising contrast gives less of a gray/washed out look than raising gamma, but at a disadvantage: colors near white get clipped to white.
<item> RMQ protocol (999) support, adapted from RMQEngine.
<item> New "-protocol x" command line option. Accepted values for 'x' are 15 (NetQuake), 666 (FitzQuake, default), and 999 (RMQ).
<item> New "setpos" console command.
<item> New "vid_borderless" cvar for getting a borderless window.
<item> Increased MAX_MAP_LEAFS from 65535 to 70000 and MAX_LIGHTMAPS from 256 to 512 in order to handle the oms3 map pack.
<item> Server edicts are now allocated using malloc instead of allocating on the hunk.
<item> gl_clear now defaults to 1.
<item> Fix items falling out of the world on oms3.bsp on SSE builds.
<item> Worked around an OSX 10.6 driver bug when using FSAA, which was leading to an unplayable HOM effect on the rest of the screen.
<item> Fix wrong trace endpoint from the tracepos console command.
<item> Updated some of the third-party libraries. Other fixes/clean-ups.
</itemize>

<item> Fix "flush" command not reloading mdl's from disk (bug introduced in 0.90.1).
<item> Prevent a possible buffer overflow in Cbuf_Execute (old Q1/Q2 bug).
<item> Prevent a possible vulnerability in MSG_ReadString (old Q1/Q2 bug).
</itemize>

<sect2> Visual improvements
<itemize>
<item> New cvars r_lavaalpha, r_slimealpha, r_telealpha for fine-tuning specific liquid opacities (from DirectQ/RMQEngine, non-archived, default to 0), and new worldspawn keys _wateralpha, _lavaalpha, _slimealpha, _telealpha, _skyfog (unique to Quakespasm, similar to the behaviour of the "fog" worldspawn key).
<item> GLSL gamma is now supported on older hardware without NPOT extension.
</itemize>

<sect2> Interface improvements
<itemize>
<item> New r_pos command to show player position.
<item> NaN detection in traceline with "developer 1" set now warns instead of errors.

</itemize>

<sect2> Code cleanup
<itemize>
<item> Clean up IDE project files to build on fresh systems.
<item> Update 3rd-party libraries.
</itemize>
</p>

<sect1> Changes in 0.90.0<p>
<itemize>
<item> Fix issues on Windows systems with DPI scaling.</item>
<item> Unix/Mac user directories support. Disabled by default, 'make DO_USERDIRS=1' to enable it.
<item> SDL2 support. Disabled by default, 'make USE_SDL2=1' to enable it.
<item> Revised keyboard input code.
<item> Revised/improved the 'game' command, i.e. on-the-fly mod changing. It now accepts an optional second argument for mission packs or quoth support i.e. -hipnotic, -rogue, or -quoth. For example, for WarpSpasm: "game warp -quoth"
<item> Command line: "-game {quoth/hipnotic/rogue}" is now treated the same as -quoth, -hipnotic, or -rogue.
<item> Console speed now resolution-independent.
<item> Disabled gl_zfix, which caused glitches and is undesirable for new maps. Replacement .ent files to fix z-fighting for several id1 maps added to quakespasm.pak.
<item> PF_VarString buffer bumped to 1024, avoids truncated centerprints from the 'In The Shadows' mod.
<item> Support for opengl non-power-of-two-textures extension (disable with command line: "-notexturenpot".)
<item> Support for OpenGL vertex buffer objects (VBO, OpenGL 1.5 or newer) for world and brush models (disable with command line: "-novbo".)
<item> Antialiasing (FSAA) support (command line: -fsaa x, where x can be 0, 2, 4, 8).
<item> Fence textures support.
<item> Dynamic light speedup. Speedup loading of tga and pcx external images.
<item> Brush model drawing speedup.
<item> Support for BSP2 and 2PSB map formats.
<item> Support for Opus, FLAC, and tracker music (S3M, IT, UMX, etc.), as compile-time options.
<item> Music and sfx now mixed at 44100 Hz to avoid downsampling music. Low-pass filter applied to the sfx if -sndspeed is 11025 (the default), to preserve the same sound quality as 0.85.9.  New -mixspeed option sets the rate for mixing sfx and music, and output to the OS (default 44100), setting it to 11025 reverts to 0.85.9 behaviour. New snd_filterquality cvar, value can be between 1 (emulate OS X resampler) and 5 (emulate Windows resampler), controls the sound of the low-pass filter.
<item> Better Hor+ field of view (FOV) scaling behavior.
<item> Better cross-map demo playback support.
<item> Fix screenshots when screen width isn't a multiple of 4.
<item> Fix a lighting glitch due to floating point precision.
<item> Fix a looping sounds glitch.
<item> Fix a vulnerability in file extension handling. Tighten path handling safety.
<item> Initialize opengl with 24-bit depth buffer at 32 bpp.
<item> Reset all models upon gamedir changes. (Fixes failures with mods using custom content.)
<item> Fix broken behavior upon gamedir changes if -basedir is specified on the command line.
<item> NET_MAXMESSAGE and MAX_MSGLEN limits bumped to 64000.
<item> MAX_EFRAGS bumped to 4096, and MAX_CHANNELS to 1024.
<item> MAX_ENT_LEAFS bumped from 16 to 32 to work around disappearing or flickering brush models in some situations. Also, if an entity is visible from MAX_ENT_LEAFS or more leafs, we now always send it to the client.
<item> Fix cvar cycle command not working sometimes.
<item> Host_Error upon missing models. (Prevents segmentation faults.)
<item> Change sv_aim default value to 1 (i.e. turn off autoaim)
<item> Add 'prev' and 'next' keywords to the 'cd' command.
<item> Work around a linux cdrom issue (playback might not start for a while after a stop).
<item> Quakespasm content customization moved from engine-embedded into a new optional quakespasm.pak file.
<item> Version bumped to 0.90.0 (because Quakespasm has a decent life of it's own)
<item> Other fixes and clean-ups.
</itemize>
</p>

<sect1> Changes in 0.85.9<p>
<itemize>
<item> Fixes for several undefined behaviors in C code (gcc-4.8 support.)
<item> Implemented Hor+ style field of view (FOV) scaling, useful for widescreen resolutions. Configured by new cvar fov_adapt: set it to 1 and your fov will be scaled automatically according to the resolution. Enabled by default.
<item> Adjusted string buffers for PR_ValueString and friends to fix crashes with excessively long global strings seen in some rude mods.
<item> Toned down warning messages from PF_VarString() a bit.
<item> Fixed Fitzquake's map existence check in changelevel (used to leak file handles which would end up in a Sys_Error() due to consuming all free handles if many maps reside not in pak files.)
<item> Fixes/cleanups in chat mode handling. Client no longer gets stuck in chat mode upon disconnect.
